# TicTacToe Game
A simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe using React with glow effect.

## How to Play

The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Player 1 starts with X and player 2 is O.
Players take turns placing their symbol on an empty square on the board.
The first player to get three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
